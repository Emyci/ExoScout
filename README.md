In our project we want to create CanSat which will act as a “scout” for a mission looking for a planet that can be settled by humans. 
After first assessments of a planet's potential habitability from space, a CanSat like device will be dropped on the planet's surface and will carry out further measurements of factors crucial to the life of the humankind. 
Data collected from primary and secondary missions will be used with a view to analyse multiple factors, which are considered to be vital for planetary habitability.
